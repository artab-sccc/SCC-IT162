        <p>
            When using a computer or mobile device to look up information on the internet, there can be thousands of websites to choose from. With lots of varying competitors, how do websites make themselves stand out in order for users to stay on their page?
        </p>

        <p>
            When viewing a webpage, the page must be designed in a way to make it look pleasing to view to the user. This can be achieved by visuals, colors and animation which captures a user’s attention to make them stay on a page. One example that a website can do this is via an image gallery. 
        </p>

        <p>
            According to Cincopa, a company who offers HTML widgets such as a photo gallery, “Adding an HTML photo gallery to your site will noy only make your page more attractive but will also engage your visitors and increase the time they spend on page.”  With CSS and jquery, there are multiple ways to display an image gallery. Two examples we will look at are an image slider and lightbox.

        <p>
            Image sliders can display multiple images which transition to another image either by a user input or automatic timer. Whereas a lightbox displays an image which can be enlarged for the user to take a closer look at it. These are two ways images can be displayed on a website. With CSS, the two can be personalized to look more capturing to the website’s design.

        <p>
            What if a website needs to utilize both? “When you create a website, it can be a real challenge to show many images to your visitors without breaking the layout. (Toth)” One way to handle this, is to both combine the two into a lightbox slider which gives the best of both worlds. For example, a lightbox slider can fill an image on the screen while keeping the current page in the background. However, at this moment, the lightbox can also have slider features to go through various images while maintaining the background. It is a very flexible design.
