        <h2>Shopping Carts</h2>

        <p>
            Many of today’s product purchases come from e-commerce websites such as Amazon or eBay. On those websites, users can browse through the site's various items it offers and add them into a virtual shopping cart to purchase them once they are ready to pay. When payment has been received, the website can then track and ship the orders using the virtual cart features. On a web developer standpoint, how does a website manage to keep track of the shopping cart along with the payment processes and orders? 
        </p>

        <p>
            Luckily, there are many websites that offer Shopping Cart software that manages all those features. Sites such as Shopify and Shopaccino allow users to create and manage their own e-commerce websites which provide features to manage products, payments and orders. They also allow users to customize the page to their own preferences. While that sounds great and easy, how does this actually work?
        </p>

        <p>
            “Much like a cash register in a brick-and-mortar store, shopping cart software comprises the customer-facing side and the employee- or business-facing side. (Cannon)” When using shopping cart software, there is a frontend (or the storefront) that the customers see. Then, there is the backend in which administers the settings and configuration. Both of these work together to provide the shopping cart experience.

        <p>
            Another great feature of the shopping cart software is that it can accommodate mobile devices. “...in the United States, 4.85% of online retail conversions take place on a smartphone or tablet. 51% of consumers time spent online is from a mobile device. (Carrizales)” This is highly beneficial as it makes the user’s e-commerce website flexible for use on any device and can expand the website’s profits. 
        </p>

        <p>
           Overall, Shopping Carts provide great benefit in enhancing a user’s shopping experience on a website. With the various shopping cart softwares available to users, there are many easy ways to get an e-commerce website set up.
